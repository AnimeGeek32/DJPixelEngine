# DJPixelEngine
My first DirectX 9.0-based 2D game engine. It isn't finished yet, but it is still functional.

Compilation instructions:
After you build the executable, copy the "data" folder in DJPixelEngine subfolder to the location where the executable is located. Also, be sure you connect the DirectInput-supported controller before you open the program.

Controls:
Left stick = player sprite movement
Right stick = camera movement
